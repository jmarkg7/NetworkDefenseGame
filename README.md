# NetworkDefenseGame

I am still working on it. 

Setting: A dystopian future where cyber warfare determines global power. Players defend a military command network from relentless AI-driven adversaries and rogue cyber-mercenaries.

Player Role: A cyber defense officer in a secret military unit, tasked with protecting critical infrastructure from evolving digital threats.

Story Beats: As players survive longer, they uncover a conspiracyâ€”an unknown entity is manipulating global conflicts through cyber attacks.

UI Themes: Players can switch between different cyberpunk and military-inspired interfaces (e.g., neon holographic, rugged tactical displays, or AI-assisted overlays).

Network Visualization: Attacks and defenses are represented in real-time with dynamic visual effects (e.g., intrusion attempts shown as digital pulses or breaches as red zones).

Customizable Command Center: Players can unlock skins or layouts for their cyber ops hub, making it feel more personal.

Players place network components (e.g., firewalls, endpoints).

Threats attack periodically, testing security defenses.

Players earn points based on uptime and defense effectiveness.
